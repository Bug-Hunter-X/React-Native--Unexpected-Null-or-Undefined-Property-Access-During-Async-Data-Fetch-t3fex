This error occurs when you try to access a property of an object that is null or undefined.  It often happens when fetching data asynchronously and trying to render components before the data has fully loaded.

```javascript
//Buggy code
const MyComponent = () => {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetch('some_api_endpoint')
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(data => setData(data));
  }, []);

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>{data.someProperty}</Text> {/* Error here if data is null */}
    </View>
  );
};
```
